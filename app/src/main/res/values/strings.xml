        1) The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row.\n
        2) You play on a three by three game board.\n
        3) The first player is known as X and the second is O.\n
        4) Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.\n
        5) X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.
